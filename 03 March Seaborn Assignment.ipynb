    "Que 1: Name any five plots that we can plot using the Seaborn library. Also, state the uses of each plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating attractive statistical graphics. It is particularly useful for creating informative and visually appealing plots for data exploration and analysis. Here are five plots that can be created using Seaborn along with their common uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scatter Plot:**\n",
    "   - **Uses:** Scatter plots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. They help in identifying patterns, trends, clusters, and correlations in the data. Seaborn's `scatterplot()` function allows customization of marker size, color, and style, and can also display additional information using hue, size, and style semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Histogram:**\n",
    "   - **Uses:** Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the data into bins and displaying the frequency or probability density of each bin. They help in understanding the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the data. Seaborn's `histplot()` function provides various options for customizing the appearance of histograms, such as bin width, color, and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bar Plot:**\n",
    "   - **Uses:** Bar plots are used to visualize the distribution of a categorical variable or to compare the values of a categorical variable across different groups. They are particularly useful for displaying counts, frequencies, or aggregated statistics of categorical data. Seaborn's `barplot()` function allows customization of bar colors, width, and orientation, and can also display error bars to visualize uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Box Plot:**\n",
    "   - **Uses:** Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, are used to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable or to compare the distributions of multiple variables or groups. They provide a summary of the central tendency, spread, and variability of the data, as well as identify potential outliers. Seaborn's `boxplot()` function provides options for grouping, ordering, and styling the boxes, as well as for displaying additional information such as outliers and quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Heatmap:**\n",
    "   - **Uses:** Heatmaps are used to visualize the pairwise relationships between variables in a dataset by displaying the correlation matrix or other measures of association as a colored grid. They help in identifying patterns, clusters, and correlations in multivariate data. Seaborn's `heatmap()` function allows customization of the color palette, annotation, and axis labels, and can also display hierarchical clustering dendrograms to reveal structure in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of plots that can be created using Seaborn. Seaborn provides a wide range of plotting functions and customization options to meet various data visualization needs."

Different events will be distinguished by color, and different regions will be distinguished by the style of the line.
